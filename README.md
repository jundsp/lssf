Matlab code that implements the Laplace state space filter with exact inference and moment matching published in the following paper at ICASSP 2020:

The script `demo.m` runs a demonstration of the Bayesian filter. Three different test data sequences are available to choose from: Laplace noise, outliers, and noise switch.
